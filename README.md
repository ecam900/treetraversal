# treetraversal
Tree Traversal Algorithm with TDD
<hr />
<b> Depth Search: </b>
<p> Implemented with recursion. It checks the deep end of the tree, then moves through the children of the deep nodes.</p>
<br />
<b> Breadth Search: </b>
<p> Also contains recursion, but uses a Queue to move through the shallow nodes and their children. After checking children
for the 'needle', if not found, it moves to the children's children. </p>
