# Two types of searches:

# Depth:   ------------------------------
# Depth first search is all about going deeper into the tree structure
# and exhausting the "children" objects before moving on to the siblings.

# Breadth: ------------------------------
# Breadth first search checks the items in order of their distance from the
# root node. First the algorithm will check each of it's children. Then it
# will move down to the second tier, which is its children's children. After
# that it will check it's childrens' childrens' children.
